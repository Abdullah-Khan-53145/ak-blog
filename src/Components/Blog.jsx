    description:
      "On October 27, 2022, Elon Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter for an enormous amount of $44 billion. With approximately ~240 Million daily active monetizable users (Q2/2022), this would equate to ~$183 per user.What followed after the acquisition can undoubtedly be described as controversial: Three top executives were immediately fired, and a week later, half of the staff was laid off. A paid model to receive a blue verified checkmark was introduced for $8 per month and was subsequently misused. A tweet by a fake account impersonating pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly that stated that they would make insulin tanked the stock and was estimated to cost $14 billion in market capitalization. And this is probably not the last thing we will hear on the way toward the new Twitter.On October 27, 2022, Elon Musk completed the acquisition of Twitter for an enormous amount of $44 billion.
