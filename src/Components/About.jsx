          <h2 className="secondary">Benefit of Teaching by sharing</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, I built this blog to preserve my experiences of learning
            programming, But then I thought there should be a platform where
            people can preserve there learning and coding experience along with
            all the new tech and tricks that theyâ€™ve learnt.
          </p>{" "}
          <br />
          <p>
            Beginners and new developers can get the benefit from the experience
            of advance developers and learn those advance tricks which they may
            master after years of coding in just a moment through reading
            experience of big developers.

          <p>
            Another thing is summarizing you work and explaining it in written
            form helps the writer himself to master it and take most out of it.
